## `Description`
This is a decentralized app running on blockchain for getting crowdfunds for the user's start-ups ideas and provide various perks to the donators.

## `Working`
- It is an app made used to raise fund for any start-ups idea in an efficient manner.
- Their are various apps pre present which can help you to collect funding for your idea.
- But after studying few apps like Indiegogo, Fundable which can't even authenticate owner i.e. owner of the campaign can even go away with all the funds for his/hers benefits.
- Apart from all, FuelADream has given an efficient solution for this. It tackles it by limiting the number of projects i.e. keeps the number of projects to be less which isn't very good solution for this.
- The problems which we are facing are :-
  ~~~
  > We can't authenticate campaign owner
  > We can't even know where the owner is spending the funds
  ~~~
- So, I came out with an efficient solution using blockchain decentralized app with reactjs as our client
- Here you can create campaign with minimum contribution by the contributor
- As after getting sufficient contribution, owner can make request and contributor can see these requests.
- Yes ! here's the solution for both problems in one go which is much more efficient i.e. owner can't have access to funds unless permitted by 50% contributors
- Owner needs to create a request for his transaction to vendor.
- And there after he has to confirm payment (through finalize button) to the vendor who's providing service.

## `Tech`
- React.js as client
- Solidity for smart contracts
- Ganache-cli for local compilation of contract
- Infura API as provider for Rinkeby blockchain network
- Metamask extention to connect chrome or edge to connect it to blockchain
